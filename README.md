## Game got canceled
### Honestly not that fun

- This game is still very simple! As of now, the main gameplay loop is as follows:
- You are placed inside a shop, there are stands in which you can retrive items from. The stands have a limited stock and take time to replenish.
- You take items that the Karens or shoppers request. If you fail to give the Karens the correct item in time, you loose a set rating ammount. If you give them the correct item in time you will gain rating.

## New Additions
- Improved touch controls
- Controller support
- Better item pickup and drop off
- More types of shoppers
- Items stands
- Better pop-up UI's
- New maps and modes
- And more planned + being planned! **(Again, game got canceled)**
