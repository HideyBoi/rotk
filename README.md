# *Rise of the Karens Continued*
[Website](https://hideyboi.github.io/projects/newrotk/)
## This game is still in very early development! Expect changes in gameplay/art/music/and more!

- This game is still very simple! As of now, the main gameplay loop is as follows:
- You are placed inside a shop, there are stands in which you can retrive items from. The stands have a limited stock and take time to replenish.
- You take items that the Karens or shoppers request. If you fail to give the Karens the correct item in time, you loose a set rating ammount. If you give them the correct item in time you will gain rating.

## New Additions
- Improved touch controls
- Controller support
- Better item pickup and drop off
- More types of shoppers
- Items stands
- Better pop-up UI's
- New maps and modes
- And more planned + being planned!
## For more information about development, don't. I'm not actually posting it anywhere.
